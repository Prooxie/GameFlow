## What is GameFlow?

GameFlow sits between your physical input — a gamepad, keyboard, mouse, or a phone on your Wi-Fi — and any game or application. It reads that input, transforms it through a saved **profile** (a stack of mapping rules), and writes the result to one or more **virtual controllers** the game sees.

This project started as a script to spare players from repetitive inputs that were damaging both their controllers and their hands. It was later rebuilt in Python as **Autofire**, then in C#/.NET as the architecture you're looking at now, since renamed GameFlow to separate the *product* from *autofire* the individual *feature*.

For the full feature reference, per-rule mechanics, and platform-by-platform verification notes, see [**WIKI.md**](WIKI.md).

## Features at a Glance

|Category|Details|
|-|-|
|**Autofire**|Button and stick autofire, hysteresis-shaped so it doesn't jitter at the trigger threshold|
|**Remapping**|Button-to-button remap with optional source suppression; toggle rules to flip other rules on/off at runtime|
|**Shift layers**|"Caps Lock for your controller" — 6 activation modes (Hold, Toggle, Latch, Cycle, Sticky, No Button), long-press-to-engage, idle auto-cancel|
|**SOCD cleaning**|Opposite-direction key resolution — Last-wins (Snap Tap), First-wins, or Neutral, per button pair|
|**Stick Trim**|Hold a digital button, a stick modulates it into an analog trigger press — deadzone, ramp rate, and reset-on-release all configurable|
|**Multi-source rows**|Many inputs → one output. Six combine modes (Maximum, Minimum, Sum, Average, Multiply, FirstActive) or a **formula** — a small dependency-free expression compiler (`s1 - s2`, `if(s1>0.5, s2, 0)`, `clamp(...)`), with 10 starter recipes|
|**Gyro aiming**|Local / Player / World reference frames, dual-threshold smoothing (kills tremor, keeps flicks sharp), 4 engage modes including a raw-stick gate, drift bias calibration, output to a stick or the mouse|
|**Touchpad mapping**|Finger-anchored virtual stick, 8-way wedge D-pad, frame-to-frame mouse mode — works on any pad with a touch surface|
|**Custom scripting**|Sandboxed Lua per control (MoonSharp), for logic the built-in rule types don't cover|
|**Button combos**|One press → a timed sequence of virtual presses|
|**Freeze macro**|Captures the stick vector on the rising edge of a button; optional pulse-while-frozen|
|**Per-device tuning**|Deadzone, anti-deadzone, full-at, sensitivity, response curve, and invert — per stick, per trigger, **per slot AND per device**, so the same pad feels different on two different slots. Rumble/lighting/adaptive-trigger settings save and reload too (see [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) for what's live vs. saved-only)|
|**Keyboard \& mouse as gamepad**|Full keyboard state (not just a handful of buttons) synthesized into a gamepad snapshot — works on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**|
|**Phone as controller**|No app install — open a URL in any phone browser on the LAN. Dual anchored sticks, 8-way D-pad, analog triggers, rumble via the Vibration API, and the phone's own **gyroscope/accelerometer** feed the same gyro pipeline a DualSense uses. Up to 16 phones at once|
|**Multiple virtual controllers**|Each "slot" is an independent input → profile → output pipeline, with its own device assignment, output kind, and output provider|
|**Profile system**|Create, duplicate, rename, import, export — JSON, human-editable|
|**Live dashboard**|Physical and virtual controllers rendered side by side, per slot|

## Requirements

### All platforms

|Requirement|Version|
|-|-|
|[.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)|10.0 or later|
|Git|Any recent version|

### SDL3 native library (required everywhere)

Gamepad/joystick input goes through SDL3 on every platform:

|Platform|File|Location|
|-|-|-|
|Windows|`SDL3.dll`|Next to `GameFlow.App.exe`|
|Linux|`libSDL3.so`|System library path, or the app directory|
|macOS|`libSDL3.dylib`|System library path (e.g. `/usr/local/lib`), or the app directory|

An optional `gamecontrollerdb.txt` ([SDL\_GameControllerDB](https://github.com/mdqinc/SDL_GameControllerDB)) in the application directory extends the built-in mapping database.

### Windows — virtual controller output

GameFlow uses [**HIDMaestro**](https://github.com/hifihedgehog/HIDMaestro) exclusively: user-mode, no kernel driver, no reboot. Drop **`HIDMaestro.Core.dll`** next to `GameFlow.App.exe` and it activates on next launch. If it isn't available, that slot has no output — GameFlow won't silently substitute something else, and the log and the slot's displayed name both say why. The app runs fine either way; the slot falls back to **Preview** (dashboard-only, no real device).

Windows also has the fullest platform support: keyboard/mouse-as-gamepad, mouse output (`SendInput`), and the only real virtual-**gamepad** output backend.

### Linux

* Gamepad input: SDL3, works out of the box.
* Keyboard/mouse-as-gamepad: real, via direct `evdev` reads (`/dev/input/eventN`) — not a Windows-only feature anymore.
* Mouse output: real, via `uinput` (creates an actual virtual input device).
* Virtual **gamepad** output: not built yet — Preview only (see [Known Limitations](#known-limitations)).

Needs the `input` group for device access without root:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
# then log out and back in
```

### macOS

* Gamepad input: SDL3, works out of the box.
* Keyboard/mouse-as-gamepad: real, via `CGEventTap` — reads system-wide (no per-device distinction; see the wiki).
* Mouse output: real, via `CGEventPost`.
* Virtual **gamepad** output: not built yet — Preview only.

Keyboard/mouse capture needs **Input Monitoring** permission (System Settings → Privacy \& Security → Input Monitoring) — without it the app runs fine, that one source just reads as empty.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prooxie/GameFlow.git
cd GameFlow
dotnet build GameFlow.sln
dotnet run --project src/GameFlow.App
```

First launch creates a default profile under:

|Platform|Location|
|-|-|
|Windows|`%LOCALAPPDATA%/AutofireNext/`|
|Linux|`\~/.local/share/AutofireNext/`|
|macOS|`\~/Library/Application Support/AutofireNext/`|

> Still named `AutofireNext` on purpose — it predates the rename, and changing it would orphan existing installs. Nobody types or sees this path; the app itself always says GameFlow.

\---

## How to Use

### Basics

1. **Profiles** tab → create a profile, or start from the default.
2. **Devices** tab → confirm your physical device is listed.
3. **Virtual controllers** panel → **Add controller** to create a slot, assign a device, pick an output kind and provider, enable it.
4. **Dashboard** → confirm the virtual side (marked with a **VIRTUAL** badge) mirrors your input through the mapping.

A slot's own virtual output is hidden from every input picker — you can't feed a virtual controller back in as a source.

### Tune a device (deadzones, curves, rumble, lighting, adaptive triggers)

**Click any virtual controller panel on the Dashboard.** The panel outlines on hover, and clicking opens that slot's tuning editor — five tabs: Sticks, Triggers, Rumble, Lighting, Adaptive. Stick and trigger changes are live immediately. Rumble/lighting/adaptive settings save per slot per device but don't reach physical hardware yet (the panel says so).

### Phone as a controller

1. Dashboard → **Web Controller** → enable it.
2. Open the shown URL (e.g. `http://10.0.0.5:8080`) on a phone on the same Wi-Fi.
3. Pick a layout, tap **Enable motion** for gyro aiming.
4. The phone appears in the device list as an ordinary gamepad — assign it to a slot like any other device.

> \*\*Windows firewall note:\*\* binding to all interfaces needs an admin URL ACL, or the server falls back to localhost-only and phones can't reach it (the log says which mode it's in):
> ```
> netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8080/ user=Everyone
> ```

### Add mapping rules

**Profiles** tab → **+ Add rule** against any control. Rules apply in declared order, every polling tick, live — no separate "apply" step.

## Configuration

`src/GameFlow.App/appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Runtime": {
    "DashboardRefreshHz": 165,
    "StartRuntimeOnLaunch": true,
    "DefaultCulture": "en",
    "Updates": {
      "RepoOwner": "Prooxie",
      "RepoName": "GameFlow",
      "AssetNamePattern": "GameFlow-{tag}-{rid}.zip",
      "UserAgent": "GameFlow-UpdateChecker"
    }
  }
}
```

|Key|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`DashboardRefreshHz`|`165`|UI refresh rate for the live dashboard|
|`StartRuntimeOnLaunch`|`true`|Whether the input/output runtime starts automatically|
|`DefaultCulture`|`en`|Fallback UI language|
|`Updates:RepoOwner` / `RepoName`|`Prooxie` / `GameFlow`|GitHub-releases update checker|

Profiles are JSON in the application data directory (see Quick Start), editable by hand or entirely through the **Profiles** tab.

---

## Providers

**Input:** `sdl` (all platforms — gamepads/joysticks everywhere, plus keyboard/mouse synthesis via platform-native raw input), `web` (phone browsers over the LAN), `demo` (animated preview, no hardware), `none`.

**Output:** `hidmaestro` (Windows, real virtual gamepad), `preview` (all platforms, dashboard-only). Mouse-cursor output (separate from gamepad output) is real on all three platforms via `SendInput` / `uinput` / `CGEventPost`.

Older profiles referencing retired providers (XInput, GameInput, x360ce, ViGEm, PS3, and similar) migrate to `sdl`/`hidmaestro` automatically.

```

Shift layers resolve first each tick, gating which rules are active. Every slot's rules live in its profile's JSON, applied in order, live. The dashboard reads from lock-free snapshot stores on its own timer, independent of the mapping pipeline's tick rate.

## Known Limitations

Documented here rather than discovered by surprise:

* **Rumble, RGB/lighting, and adaptive triggers save and reload correctly, but don't reach physical hardware yet.** They need a dedicated effects thread — direct SDL writes were found to block the runtime tick over Bluetooth, so this is deliberately not wired in until that thread exists.
* **No virtual *gamepad* output on Linux or macOS.** Mouse output is real on both; a real virtual controller (via `uinput`'s gamepad mode, or DriverKit on macOS) is future work.
* **Bundled controller theme placement is known-imperfect** on some skins — several were generated from asset-pack sprites without authoritative layout data. Fixing this properly needs template-matching each sprite against its base image; tracked, not yet done.
* **CGEventTap (macOS) has no per-device keyboard/mouse distinction** — one aggregate stream for the whole system, not per-physical-device like Windows/Linux.
* **Remote Link, DSU/Cemuhook motion server, per-app profile switching** — on the roadmap, not started.
