/// tracks its own running position internally, adding each requested
/// delta before posting an absolute-position mouse-moved event.

/// <para>
/// <b>Known limitation:</b> this does NOT set kCGMouseEventDeltaX/Y on
/// the synthesized event — only the absolute position. Most consumers
/// (anything tracking cursor position frame-to-frame, which is most
/// UI and many games) work fine with that. A game reading raw HID
/// deltas directly (bypassing cursor tracking entirely, common for
/// "mouse-look" in some titles) may not respond to this. The delta
/// field's exact CGEventField index is one of the least-certain
/// constants in this whole macOS effort (see MacEventInterop.cs) —
/// setting it wrong risks corrupting some OTHER field on the event
/// silently, which is worse than the honest limitation of only
/// supporting absolute-tracking consumers.
